## Step 3: Initalize Space-Acres

1. The welcome screen provides an overview of the necessary prerequisites for running Space Acres effectively. Make sure you meet all listed requirements before proceeding. For a comprehensive list of prerequisites and explanations, refer to our [prerequisites guide.](./space-acres-prerequisites.mdx)

2. Configure your node and farmer settings by providing the following:
    - Node path 
    - Rewards address
    - Farm path
    - Farm size
    - *(Optional) Add additional farms by selecting `Add farm`*

    Click Start after the configuration is complete.

3. (Optional) If you want to configure advanced settings, toggle the `Advanced configuration` section. This will allow you to set the following:
    - Substrate Node P2P Port
    - Subspace DSN P2P Port
    - Enable Faster Networking (QUIC)

    For more information on networking and its implications, refer to our [networking guide.](../additional-guides/networking)

4. The application will then proceed to load, creating the consensus node and connecting to the network.

5. Finally, you will see the main interface of Space Acres, where your consensus node is running and your farmer is progressing along. Initial syncing & plotting may take some time to complete.

## Step 4: Start Farming

Now that Space Acres is set up, your farming operation will begin automatically. Monitor the application for the status of your farming and the accrual of rewards.
