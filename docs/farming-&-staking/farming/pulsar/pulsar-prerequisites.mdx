### System Requirements

:::caution

The Pulsar application is experiencing functional issues when used in conjunction with Gemini 3g. We strongly advise users to switch to the [Advanced CLI](../advanced-cli/cli-prerequisites) method for effective farming on the Subspace Network during this period. Our team is diligently working to resolve these compatibility problems and restore full functionality to Pulsar at the earliest opportunity.

:::danger Farming can be Network Intensive.

Make sure you have a stable network connection. During the plotting phase of farming, it can be network intensive.

This may impact your network usage so please check your network connection if you have a hard data limit.

### Security Considerations

For a secure farming setup, ensure your system is updated, use a secure wallet, configure firewalls properly, and follow network safety protocols. Detailed security practices are available on our [Security Best Practices page](../../../learn/security).

### Crypto Wallet

Before running anything you need to have a wallet where you'll receive testnet coins. There are currently two wallets we suggest using, SubWallet being the preferred route.
- [SubWallet](https://subwallet.app/)
- [PolkadotJS](https://polkadot.js.org/extension/)

Install one of the two wallets above into your browser and create a new account there.
The address of your account will be necessary at the last step.

For help refer to our forum post [How to setup Subwallet & a Polkadot.js Wallet](https://forum.subspace.network/t/subspace-wallet/61)
- *make sure to follow the Bonus section of the bottom of the post above.*



### Required Ports

For the smooth operation of our blockchain node, specific ports must be open to handle incoming connections. These ports are essential for various functions within our network.

#### Ports to Open

Ensure the following **TCP** and **UDP** ports are open for incoming connections:

1. **30333 (Blockchain Network Port):** This is the primary port for blockchain network communication. It's essential for the node to connect and interact with the blockchain network.

2. **30433 (DSN Listener Port):** This port is used by the node to listen to the Decentralized Storage Network (DSN). It's crucial for data storage and retrieval operations within the blockchain ecosystem.

3. **30533 (Farmer Listener Port):** This port is designated for the farmer to listen to the DSN. It plays a key role in managing and operating the decentralized farming activities on the network.

#### Special Note on Port 9944

- **9944 (RPC Port):** This port is used for Remote Procedure Call (RPC) between the node and the farmer. It's important to note that port 9944 does **not** require forwarding if the node and farmer are on the same local network, as they communicate internally.

#### Configuring Your Network

- **Router Configuration (Desktop):** If you're using a router, you'll need to forward the specified TCP and UDP ports to the machine running your node. The process varies across different router models. Please refer to our [How to Forward Ports](../Additional-Guides/port-forwarding) guide for a detailed tutorial.

- **No Firewall Scenario:** If your server operates without a firewall, no additional configuration is needed.

- **With Firewall:** Ensure that the above-mentioned TCP and UDP ports are open in your firewall settings.

- **Direct Connection:** If your computer is connected directly to the internet (without a router), no further action is required.

By correctly configuring these ports, you ensure reliable and secure communication within our blockchain network.
