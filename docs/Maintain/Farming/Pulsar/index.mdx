:::tip Recommended
[Pulsar](https://github.com/subspace/pulsar) (previously Subspace CLI or Simple CLI) is the recommended way to farm on the Subspace Network. To get started, follow the guide below. For more information, you can check out the project [README on GitHub](https://github.com/subspace/pulsar/blob/main/README.md).

## Pre-Requisites

---

### System Requirements

:::danger Farming can be Network Intensive.

Make sure you have a stable network connection. During the plotting phase of farming, it can be network intensive.

This may impact your network usage so please check your network connection if you have a hard data limit.
:::

Pulsar requires commodity hardware specs to operate. At a **minimum**, it is recommended to have:

| Hardware | Specs            |
| -------- | ---------------- |
| CPU      | 4 Core+          |
| RAM      | 8GB+             |
| SWAP     | 4GB              |
| Storage  | 100GB SSD        |

:::note SWAP Warning
A swap is only necessary if you have a low amount of RAM. 
:::

### Getting A Crypto Wallet

Before running anything you need to have a wallet where you'll receive testnet coins.
Follow our how-to guides in the [Wallets section](/docs/category/wallets/) of the documentation for steps on how to get your wallet setup.

### Required ports

Currently, a few ports need to be exposed for node to work properly.

If you have a server with no firewall, there is nothing to be done, but otherwise make sure to open the following TCP and UDP ports for incoming connections.

- `30333`
- `30433`
- `30533`

On the desktop side if you have a router in front of your computer, you'll need to forward TCP and UDP ports to the machine on which your node is running (how this is done varies from router to router, but there is always a feature like this, refer to [How to Forward Ports](port-forwarding.md) for a more in-depth tutorial).
If you're connected directly without any router, then again nothing needs to be done in such case.

:::caution

Some older processors/VMs are no longer supported by official releases, but can still be compiled manually if desired

:::

Precompiled versions of the Pulsar is [hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/subspace/pulsar/releases). This is the recommended way to install the application. Please find the appropriate binary for your operating system.

:::info

We have included a few tutorials below that may help you in your support journey, this is not an all inclusive list but we welcome contributions

:::

### Wipe Node & Farmer

:::tip Updated from a previous version and now having issues?

Occasionally after updating to a new version of the Pulsar you will need to wipe your node and farmer, generally this should not be required but can be attempted if your farmer is having issues after having had worked fine previously.

:::

To simply restart the node, go to the terminal where you started the `farm` command, and press `Ctrl + C` you should see a shutdown message appear and the application will attempt a simple shutdown, if you dont see the message press `Ctrl + C` again to force shutdown. You can then simply start the farmer again with the `farm` command you used prior.

Use the same file name as the previous init and farm steps, then add the wipe command to free the previous storage that was being used. Generally, only do this if you have severe errors and are prompted by a staff member.

```shell-session
./pulsar-file-name wipe
```

After wiping, follow the `init` and `farm` steps above to start farming again!


### View your Logs

A good place to start if you are facing trouble is by viewing your logs and seeing if there are any errors or insights that might be available. You can find the location for your logs below:

- **üñºÔ∏è Windows:** `%USERPROFILE%/AppData/Local/pulsar/logs`
- **üçé macOS:** `$HOME/Library/Logs/pulsar/`
- **üêß Ubuntu:** `$HOME/.local/share/pulsar/logs`


### Enable Rust Backtrace 

When running the Subspace Network Farmer & Node, sometimes you may encounter an error message that includes a line similar to the following:

```text
Backtrace omitted. Run with RUST_BACKTRACE=1 environment variable to display it.
```

This error message means that Rust (the programming language that Subspace Network Farmer & Node is written in) has encountered a problem and has provided a diagnostic backtrace that can help diagnose the issue. However, by default, the backtrace is not displayed. To see the backtrace, you need to enable the `RUST_BACKTRACE` environment variable.

To enable the `RUST_BACKTRACE` enter the following into your terminal:

- **üñºÔ∏è Windows**(PowerShell): `$Env:RUST_BACKTRACE=1`
- **üçé macOS**: `export RUST_BACKTRACE=1`
- **üêß Ubuntu**: `export RUST_BACKTRACE=1`

Once you have enabled the RUST_BACKTRACE simply rerun the application and you will get additional info upon any errors. 


### Specify Version

The `settings.toml` file contains critical configurations for Pulsar, including the network your node connects to. Specify your network environment by setting the `chain` variable under the `[node]` section:

```toml
# settings.toml
[node]
chain = 'gemini-3g' //In this Example we have set to Gemini-3g
# ... additional configuration settings ...
```

Set the `chain` value to your target network identifier.
- Local Development: Set to `dev`
- Gemini Testnet: Set to `gemini-3g`

If you want to learn more about Tmux and its options check out their Repo [here](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki)

:::

* Create a new tmux session using a socket file named farming

```shell-session
$ tmux -S farming
```


* Move process to background by detaching
```text
Ctrl+b d OR ‚åò+b d (Mac)
```

* To re-attach
```shell-session
$ tmux -S farming attach
```

* Alternatively, you can use the following single command to both create (if not exists already) and attach to a session:
```shell-session
$ tmux new-session -A -D -s farming
```

* To delete farming session
```shell-session
$ tmux kill-session -t farming
```
